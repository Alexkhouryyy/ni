"""Write-approval gate — stage memory/note/skill writes for the user to approve.

When config.MEMORY_WRITE_APPROVAL (or SKILL_WRITE_APPROVAL) is True, mutating
calls are parked in the staged_writes table and a push notification is sent
instead of being applied immediately. The user approves or rejects from the
dashboard (or via the approve/reject helpers), at which point the write is
applied with the approval gate bypassed.

Mirrors the cortex pending_actions pattern so the dashboard UX is consistent.
