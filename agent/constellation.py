"""The Constellation — a standing panel of 12 domain-expert "planets".

Apex (the core AgentCore) is the Sun. Orbiting it are 12 specialists, each an
expert in one domain (Finance, Health, Engineer, Strategist, Devil's Advocate…),
each with its own persistent memory that grows over time. On a query, the
relevant planets answer IN PARALLEL from their own expertise + memory, then the
Sun synthesizes their takes into one answer — noting where the experts split.

Design (deliberately mirrors agent/council.py):
  - Each planet is ONE constrained model call (the council-member pattern), not a
    full tool-using sub-agent — so convening 4 planets costs ~4 calls, not ~120.
    A planet's "tools" are a descriptive lens in its system prompt, not live tools.
  - Fan-out/fan-in via ThreadPoolExecutor; the Sun's synthesis reuses council's
    `_parse_verdict` verbatim (keep the "Where the council split:" wording).
  - Persistence: each planet keeps an Obsidian-visible journal at
    ~/Documents/Apex/Planets/{Display}.md AND tagged rows in the semantic
    `memories` table (tags="planet:{key}"). After a convene, a cheap off-thread
    Haiku pass distills one durable fact per planet.

Invocation:
  - Manual: the `consult_experts` tool, the `/experts` command, POST /api/constellation.
  - Auto: core.run() folds a synthesized briefing into high-stakes turns when
    CONSTELLATION_AUTO is on (route() returns [] for low-stakes → zero cost).
