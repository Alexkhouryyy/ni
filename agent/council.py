"""Multi-model council — Claude, GPT, and Gemini debate to reach the best answer.

Flow:
  1. Opening statements — each member answers the question independently.
  2. Debate — each member reads every answer, critiques them, and revises
     or defends its own.
  3. Synthesis — a chair model consolidates the debate into one best answer.

Members are included only when their provider has an API key configured, so
the council degrades gracefully (minimum 2 members required). Callers may pass
an `on_answer` callback to stream the debate live as each member responds.
