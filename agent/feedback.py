"""User feedback on completed turns.

A turn is one user→assistant exchange identified by (session_id, turn_index).
Feedback is a thumbs-up (+1) or thumbs-down (-1) with an optional comment,
captured from the dashboard chat, the CLI (`/feedback +1`), or recognized
voice phrases ("thumbs up", "that was wrong").

This data is the raw signal the rest of the self-improvement loop (outcome
scoring, auto-rollback experiments, reflection re-ranking) will key off of.
