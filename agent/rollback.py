"""Auto-rollback for skill rewrites that hurt approval rate.

check_rewrites() is called:
  - At the end of every reflection.consolidate() cycle
  - On demand via POST /api/outcomes/check-rollback

Algorithm per rewrite:
  1. Skip if not enough post-rewrite rated turns yet (< MIN_RATED_TURNS)
  2. Compute post-rewrite approval_rate using skill_rate_in_window()
  3. If delta (post - pre) < -DROP_THRESHOLD → rollback
  4. If post_rated_turns >= CONFIRM_TURNS and no drop → mark 'confirmed'

Both thresholds and the minimum turn count are configurable via config.py or
fall back to the defaults below.
